Welcome!

I am a Postgraduate Researcher at the [School of Global Development, University of East Anglia](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/school-of-global-development). My dissertation explores decision-making processes in climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction, under the supervision of [Prof. Bereket Kebede](https://sites.google.com/view/bereket-kebede/profile) and [Prof. Pieter Serneels](https://sites.google.com/site/pieterserneels/about-me?authuser=0).

My broader research interests include industry, international business, sustainable development, and economic geography. I focus particularly on how climate risks and economic uncertainty affect development outcomes, with an emphasis on policy evaluation, foreign direct investment, and spatial economic dynamics.

I currently lecture on statistics, business, and economics at Paramadina University and serve as a researcher at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF), Indonesia.
