I am a postgraduate Researcher at the [School of Global Development, University of East Anglia](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/school-of-global-development) under the supervision of [Prof. Bereket Kebede](https://sites.google.com/view/bereket-kebede/profile) and [Prof. Pieter Serneels](https://sites.google.com/site/pieterserneels/about-me?authuser=0).

My broader research interests include development economics, environmental economics, and industrial organization. I focus particularly on the impacts of climate variability, foreign investment, and policy enforcement, using both experimental and econometric methods.

I currently lecture on statistics, business, and economics at Paramadina University and serve as a researcher at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF), Indonesia.
