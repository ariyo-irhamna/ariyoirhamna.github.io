Welcome!

I am a Postgraduate Researcher at the [School of Global Development, University of East Anglia](https://www.uea.ac.uk/about/school-of-global-development). My dissertation explores decision-making processes in climate adaptation and disaster risk reduction, under the supervision of [Prof. Bereket Kebede](https://sites.google.com/view/bereket-kebede/profile) and [Prof. Pieter Serneels](https://sites.google.com/site/pieterserneels/about-me?authuser=0).

I am an applied microeconomist specialising in climate change, labour markets, and behavioural responses. My main research interests centre on how climate change causally impacts development outcomes through changing behaviour and decision-making. I employ large-scale, multi-level survey data and weather/climate data combined with advanced causal inference techniques.

My secondary research interest explores the global value chain, international economics, and spatial economic dynamics.

Since 2014, I have served as a researcher at the Institute for Development of Economics and Finance (INDEF) in Indonesia. 

Additionally, I have held Associate Fellowship status with the Higher Education Academy (AFHEA) since 2024.

  <strong>Abstract:</strong><br>
  The behavioral foundations of adaptation decisions under normal weather variability remain understudied. Most smallholder farmers experience frequent, moderate weather fluctuations in the short term rather than rare extreme events, and these everyday variations shape adaptation choices over time. This is particularly pronounced for private irrigation, where farmers autonomously decide the timing and type of irrigation based on local conditions. Using panel data from 17,443 household-year observations in rural Thailand and Vietnam (2007â€“2017), we estimate a correlated random effects logit model with an autoregressive distributed lag structure to identify causal effects, addressing unobserved heterogeneity and state dependence. The results are robust across pooled logit, random effects, and fixed effects specifications. We find predominantly reactive adaptation: farmers respond to contemporaneous weather conditions, with prior irrigation experience strongly predicting current adoption, while lagged weather signals have no significant effect. Robustness checks using temperature and precipitation yield inconsistent patterns, but results with a water balance index (SPEI) are strong and consistent, highlighting the importance of integrated climate indicators in analyzing adaptation. These findings provide evidence that adaptation is shaped by immediate conditions and experience, informing policies to support first-time irrigation adoption and to strengthen anticipatory resilience under climate variability.
