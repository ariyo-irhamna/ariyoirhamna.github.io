excerpt        : "This study investigates the drivers of global agricultural value chain (GAVC) participation in six ASEAN countries: Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Employing panel geographically weighted regression, the paper analyzes the spatial heterogeneity of factors influencing global agricultural value chain participation. Our findings reveal significant variations in the impact of tariffs, FDI, agricultural land area, inland waters, and trade balance across countries. Tariffs emerge as a crucial factor in enhancing competitiveness in Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand, aligning with trade theory. FDI positively influences Malaysia's global agricultural value chain participation, emphasizing attracting foreign investment. Agricultural land area plays a pivotal role in Indonesia and Thailand, highlighting the significance of resource endowments. Inland waters contribute significantly to agriculture in the Philippines, while their impact in Indonesia suggests potential inefficiencies in water management. Trade balance in food products positively affects global agricultural value chain involvement in Thailand and Vietnam. These findings underscore the need for tailored policies to address the unique characteristics of each ASEAN country. Future research should explore the long-term implications of these factors and consider broader socio-economic and environmental contexts."

The behavioral foundations of adaptation decisions under normal weather variability remain understudied. Most smallholder farmers experience frequent, moderate weather fluctuations in the short term rather than rare extreme events, and these everyday variations shape adaptation choices over time. This is particularly pronounced for private irrigation, where farmers autonomously decide the timing and type of irrigation based on local conditions. Using panel data from 17,443 household-year observations in rural Thailand and Vietnam (2007â€“2017), we estimate a correlated random effects logit model with an autoregressive distributed lag structure to identify causal effects, addressing unobserved heterogeneity and state dependence. The results are robust across pooled logit, random effects, and fixed effects specifications. We find predominantly reactive adaptation: farmers respond to contemporaneous weather conditions, with prior irrigation experience strongly predicting current adoption, while lagged weather signals have no significant effect. Robustness checks using temperature and precipitation yield inconsistent patterns, but results with a water balance index (SPEI) are strong and consistent, highlighting the importance of integrated climate indicators in analyzing adaptation. These findings provide evidence that adaptation is shaped by immediate conditions and experience, informing policies to support first-time irrigation adoption and to strengthen anticipatory resilience under climate variability.
